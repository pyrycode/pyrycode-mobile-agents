# docs-guard.sh — bounds the size of the feature overviews under docs/knowledge/features,
# keeps their heading structure honest, and holds them to the formatting spotless applies.
#
#   scripts/docs-guard.sh
#
# Scans every .md file under docs/knowledge/features and exits non-zero on any of four
# faults: a file over the size cap; a line that markdown reads as a heading only because a
# wrapped paragraph put a ticket reference first; a line with trailing whitespace; and an
# end of file that is not exactly one newline. One run reports every problem it finds.
#
# Ported rule-for-rule from pyrycode's cmd/docs-guard (Go, in `make check`) and desktop's
# scripts/docs-guard.mjs (`npm run check:docs`) on 2026-09-05. Keep the three in step:
# the cap and the heading pattern are the same numbers and the same regex, and the
# dispatcher's src/docs-size.ts flags the same files to the documentation agent before
# it writes. This one is shell because the repo has no Go or Node toolchain, and the
# dispatcher runs it as the first entry of PYRY_VERIFIER_GATES so it fails fast ahead of
# the Gradle gates.
#
# Why the size cap: QMD is the search surface every agent uses. It cuts a document into
# roughly 900-token chunks and prefers to break at a heading, but it only looks for that
# boundary inside a narrow window around each cut point. When a document's sections run
# much larger than one chunk, no heading falls inside the window, the cut lands on a
# paragraph break, and the chunk carries no heading with it. Measured on pyrycode
# 2026-08-31: a 315KB overview was not returned by semantic, hybrid or keyword search
# for a topic whose canonical home was one of its own sections.
#
# Why the heading check: a paragraph line that wraps with a ticket reference first,
# "#623 pages a conversation's history...", is a top-level heading as far as markdown is
# concerned. It corrupts the document outline and moves the boundaries the chunker
# prefers to cut on.
#
# Why the two formatting checks: format("misc") in the root build.gradle.kts covers every
# *.md in the repo with trimTrailingWhitespace() and endWithNewline(), so a trailing space
# or a blank line at EOF fails ./gradlew spotlessCheck — and because check fails fast at
# :spotlessMiscCheck, it aborts the whole gate chain ahead of the unit suite, lint,
# assembleDebug, the androidTest compile and both device gates. These overviews are written
# by the documentation stage, which runs after the verifier gate and after merge, so its own
# output is the one thing in the tree that no Gradle gate ever sees before it lands on main.
# Nor can any pre-merge stage repair it: these files are documentation-stage-owned and the
# builder and verifier prompts both forbid writing them. That leaves this script — the check
# the documentation stage runs before it commits — as the only gate standing in front of the
# only role allowed to fix the fault. Measured on 2026-09-22 (#754): the same trailing blank
# line was written into settings-screen-how-it-works.md on three separate runs, two builders
# correctly reverted the spotlessApply fix to preserve byte-identity with main, and four
# verifier passes spent budget proving the red was not theirs.
#
# Why code and not a rule in a prompt: both faults are produced by the documentation
# phase, which already carries a prose rule against them. A prose rule is advisory. A
# safety net for one must be a different fabric: deterministic code, not a second rule
# that shares the first one's blind spot.

# The only directory scanned. Decisions and the frozen per-ticket archive are
